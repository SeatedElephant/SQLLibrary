# SQLLibrary
This library contains useful SQL code I have collected from individuals that have made their work freely available and also code that I have written myself.

WARNING - some of the code contains DELETE, DROP, ALTER, UPDATE, etc. statements and if run on a SQL instance may delete or change data or the database schema. Please run only on a test instance until you are sure that the code meets your needs.

All code is freely available for use and adaptation but is used wholly at the users risk, and no liability in anyway accepted.
